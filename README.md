# 24G-Front-End-Test-Project
Build a single webpage that is used to display popular recipes recommended by members of the 24G team. Functionality, coding practices, and resources used are up to your best judgement. 24G uses the Vue framework, but that is not a requirement for this test project. The intent of this project is for you to demonstrate your ability to build a page based on a provided design comp and specs. You will be evaluated on your project submission quality both in code and functionality.
