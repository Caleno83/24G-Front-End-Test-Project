<h3>Things That I Learned</h3>

<a>
The only thing that I learned so much, and It took a little bit of time was creating modals, and adding all the information there from the API Get Request.  It was nice learning something new as always
</a>

<h3>Things That Gave Me Difficulty</h3>

<a> There were smalls errors that I got, but after searching it in google, I could debug the issue.
-one problem was that I got this error "warning-react-modal-app-element-is-not-defined-please-use-modal-setappeleme
".  I resolve this issue thanks to this article: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48269381/warning-react-modal-app-element-is-not-defined-please-use-modal-setappeleme
- other issues happened when I was tryng to create a card inside a modal, and it was a little difficult to added it because I was gettting opacity as the main mmodal, but I was trying to show the descriptiong to the Card Modal.  After working around, and checking few articles, I could fixed the problem
-Another problem that I encountered was trying to scroll the drinks description from the modal, and trying to block the scrolling from the background images.  After few documentation readings, I found the right documentation, and learned what I was doing wrong, and how to do it the right way</a>
